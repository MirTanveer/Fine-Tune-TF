##  Important Notes

- For easy setup of a conda environment to run the notebooks, you can use the provided **`finetune.yml`** file in this folder.  
- Check [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) for instructions on setting up an environment from a `.yml` file.  
- For detailed examples, refer to the information inside the notebooks.

###  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

- PEFT is utilized through **[Hugging Face PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft)**.  
- **LoRA** fine-tuning is used as the default setting.  
- Optionally, full model fine-tuning can be performed (recommended for models smaller than *ESM2 650M*).  
- Other adapters from Hugging Face PEFT can be easily integrated.

###  Memory Efficiency Tips

- Always enable **mixed precision training**.  
- If GPU memory overflows:
  1. Reduce the batch size to 1 and simulate larger batches using **gradient accumulation**.
